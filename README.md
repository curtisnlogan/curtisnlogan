### 🧠 About Me
I’m a full-stack developer specialising in **Python, PostgreSQL and JavaScript**, focused on creating **secure, maintainable, and accessible** web applications.  
My **War Studies degree from King’s College London** (cybersecurity specialism) strengthened my analytical thinking, documentation discipline, and security-first mindset — all of which underpin my approach to software development.

## 🧭 How I Work

### 💡 Before Coding
- **Understanding** – You don’t need to know everything, only what’s necessary to solve the problem.  
- **Fundamentals** – Strong fundamentals make everything else possible.  
- **Projects First** – Real projects teach more than theory; code challenges and textbooks are supporting tools, not the main course.  
- **Planning** – Design deliberately before you write a single line. Clear plans save hours of debugging later.

### 🧩 During Coding
- **🤖 AI** – Use AI as a collaborator, not a crutch. Always understand the code you ship.  
- **📝 Documentation** – Write docs that communicate intent, not noise. Clarity > verbosity.  
- **🔧 Git** – Your version history is your time machine: commit atomically and explain *why* changes exist.  
- **🧠 Decomposition** – Break problems into smaller, testable pieces. Pseudocode first if it helps you think.  
- **🪶 Craftsmanship** – Code for your future self. Remember *YAGNI*, *KISS*, and *DRY*.  
- **🧪 Testing** – Test what matters; treat untested code as broken by default.  
- **♻️ Refactor** – Leave the codebase cleaner than you found it. Small, continuous improvements compound fast.

### 🔁 After Coding
- **🪞 Reflection** – Review what worked, what didn’t, and how you’ll approach it better next time.  
- **🌐 Community** – Learn in public. Share, teach, and connect — knowledge grows when it’s shared!
