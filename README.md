## Junior Full-Stack Developer

I'm currently sharpening my hard and soft skills in the Code Institute's Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. My journey into tech began with a love for problem-solving and a curiosity about how computers work. I kicked off with Harvard's CS50P and moved into a comprehensive full-stack curriculum.

Based in the üìç Manchester Area, United Kingdom, I‚Äôm eager to land junior developer roles where I can contribute to creative, user-focused projects.
