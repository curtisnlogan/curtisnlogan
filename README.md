## Summary
Backend-focused software engineer currently specialising in **Python, Django, and PostgreSQL**.  
I work with a structured, repeatable process that use best-practices to produce clear, reliable, and maintainable software.  

My background in **War Studies and cybersecurity** gives me strong analytical thinking: I clarify intent, reduce uncessary complexity, and design predictable behaviour.

## My Engineering Approach
clarify → slice → sketch → implement → test → reflect
A minimal workflow that keeps delivery consistent, safe, and incremental.
