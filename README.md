👋 Hi, I’m Curtis Logan — a backend-focused full-stack developer who builds reliable, maintainable software with a structured engineering mindset. My work is grounded in Python (Django), PostgreSQL, and JavaScript (ES6+), supported by a clear, repeatable process that helps me deliver quality consistently.

🧠 About Me
I’m an early-career software engineer shaped by a background in War Studies and cybersecurity at King’s College London — disciplines that trained me to analyse systems, clarify assumptions, and approach complexity with discipline rather than improvisation.

After completing an AI-augmented full-stack bootcamp, I’ve focused on developing a dependable engineering workflow that teams can trust. My strengths lie in thinking in systems, tightening scope, and writing backend logic that is clear, testable, and maintainable.

🧵 My Engineering Operating System
A lightweight workflow that keeps me systematic and predictable:

clarify → slice → sketch → implement → test → reflect

clarify: define intent, constraints, inputs/outputs, and edge cases
slice: identify the smallest valuable deliverable
sketch: outline flow and behaviour before coding
implement: write the simplest solution that meets the constraints
test: verify expected behaviour, meaningful edge cases, and invariants
reflect: validate outcomes, capture lessons, and refine for future work
This process allows me to deliver in small, safe steps while maintaining clarity throughout the work.

🧑‍💻 Featured Projects
Lodestar — Full-stack Django + PostgreSQL application integrating NASA and SIMBAD APIs. Focus on robust data ingestion, boundary clarity, and fault-tolerant architecture.
Quizia — API-powered quiz platform. Refactored system design to eliminate 30+ redundant API calls and streamline performance.
Art-by-CK — Client-facing Django site with automated email triggers and accessible, responsive UI.
Prevent — Security- and accessibility-first static site designed for online safety awareness. Prioritised clarity, simplicity, and user trust.

💬 Let’s Build Something
I’m seeking opportunities as a backend-leaning full-stack developer, ideally in teams that value engineering discipline, clarity, and structured thinking. I bring a calm, analytical approach to complex problems and a workflow that makes me a reliable contributor from day one.
