## Summary
Backend-focused software engineer currently specialising in **Python, Django, and PostgreSQL**.  
I work with a structured, best-practices process that is intended to produce reliable and maintainable software solutions.

My pre-Bootcamp background in **War Studies and cybersecurity** gives me strong analytical thinking: I seek to clarify intent, reduce uneccessary complexity, and code predictable behaviour.

---

## My Engineering Approach
clarify → slice → sketch → implement → test → reflect.
A minimal workflow that keeps delivery consistent, safe, and manageable.
